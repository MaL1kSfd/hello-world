My first repository! OMG, it is so exciting guys!

They told me write something about myself, and use some markdown something. I will actually not do it, but who cares, so I will just say that penguins are actually not birds (no one's gonna see this anyway). I am vengeance!

When someone asked what drinking water in water feels like:
string water = "water";
Console.Writeline($"This is how it feels like: {water}");
You got that? Haha, the variable name is water and it contains the word water. HA :)
this is dumb, I know
